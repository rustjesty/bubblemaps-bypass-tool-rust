# Bubblemaps Bypass Tool

A sophisticated Rust-based tool designed to obfuscate wallet funding sources and avoid detection by Bubblemaps tracking systems. This tool implements advanced transaction obfuscation techniques to maintain privacy and anonymity in Solana blockchain interactions.

## üöÄ Features

- **Advanced Wallet Obfuscation**: Implements sophisticated techniques to obscure funding sources
- **Solana Integration**: Built specifically for Solana blockchain with native SOL and SPL token support
- **Transaction Simulation**: Includes transaction simulation capabilities for safe testing
- **Async Architecture**: High-performance async/await implementation for optimal throughput
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed tracing and logging for monitoring and debugging
- **Modular Design**: Clean, maintainable codebase with separated concerns

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Rust (2021 edition)
- **Blockchain**: Solana (SDK v2.2.2)
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio with full features
- **Token Support**: SPL Token & SPL Token 2022
- **DEX Integration**: Jupiter DCA integration

### Key Dependencies
- `solana-sdk` - Core Solana functionality
- `solana-client` - RPC client for blockchain interaction
- `spl-token` - SPL token operations
- `apex-primitives` - Apex trading primitives
- `jupiter-sdk` - Jupiter DEX integration
- `tokio` - Async runtime

## üìã Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ with Cargo
- Solana CLI tools (optional, for local development)
- Valid Solana RPC endpoint
- Sufficient SOL balance for transaction fees

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bubblemaps-bypass-tool-rust
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Configure environment**:
   Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```env
   RPC_URL=your_solana_rpc_endpoint
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Obfuscation
```bash
cargo run --release
```

### Advanced Configuration
The tool supports various configuration options through environment variables and command-line arguments. Refer to the source code for detailed configuration options.

## üîí Security Features

- **Transaction Simulation**: All transactions are simulated before execution
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with `anyhow` crate
- **Secure Key Management**: Proper keypair handling and signing
- **Validation**: Input validation and sanitization

## üìä Architecture

### Core Modules
- `main.rs` - Application entry point and orchestration
- `obfuscate.rs` - Core obfuscation logic and transaction building
- `executor/` - Transaction execution and confirmation
- `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `common/` - Shared configuration and constants

### Obfuscation Process
1. **Wallet Creation**: Generates new temporary wallets
2. **Token Operations**: Creates and manages WSOL accounts
3. **Transaction Building**: Constructs obfuscated transaction sequences
4. **Execution**: Safely executes transactions with simulation
5. **Cleanup**: Proper resource cleanup and account management
